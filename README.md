# **React Admin - PG-Dashboard**

PG-Dashboard is an application developed with React Admin for managing the administration interfaces of the Groove-Tickets e-commerce platform. It provides an intuitive and functional interface for managing and controlling various aspects of the system.

## Key Features

- **Auth Provider**: The application utilizes an `AuthProvider` to handle user authentication and authorization. This provider manages backend authentication, including credential verification, access token management, and protection of application routes and resources. It provides a security layer to ensure that only authorized users can access and utilize the system's functionalities.

- **Data Provider**: PG-Dashboard uses a `DataProvider` to interact with the backend API and manage data. This provider acts as an abstraction layer between the user interface and the server, allowing for easy CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It provides methods for requesting data, sending updates, and receiving server responses, facilitating data management and synchronization within the application.

## CRUD Components

Each component in PG-Dashboard is designed to enable the creation, editing, and deletion of specific system elements. These components are integral to the administration interface and provide an intuitive way to manage and maintain data.

## Styling and Design

For the visual appearance and design of PG-Dashboard, Material-UI has been used. Material-UI is a popular UI component library for React that provides a set of predefined components and styles following the principles of Material Design. These components offer a consistent and visually appealing user experience, enhancing the overall usability and aesthetics of the application.
